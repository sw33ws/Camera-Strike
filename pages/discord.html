                        Discord was initially released as a free communication application - bundling many of the features of their
                        predecessors into one, creating a streamline service for online communities to connect and share together, but grew to be the 
                        one of the most platforms used online for communication overall. 
                        Whether through text, voice, video or files, Discord is a multi-use platform that can be used in many different environments
                        including but not limited to educational, professional, gaming communities, or even just personal use.

                        Discord allows users to create servers, in which they may specify what and who the content shared is shared to - set events, collaborate for project purposes,
                        and much more. Within these servers, you have the ability to set special permissions, as well as seamlessly create structured servers to file share within.
