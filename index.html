                <h2>
                    Improving school learning and collaboration
                </h2>

                <p>
                    With online class's becoming more and more common, the use of pen and pencil is rapidal being replaced with digitals tools.
                    Unfortunately not all digital tools are helpful, and accessible for the average user. With paywalls, confusing and /or 
                    broken features It can be come pretty hard to find useful tools for individual work, much less group work.
                    So we at cameraStrike have put together of a list of three tools we think you should get formilar with.

                    <br><br>

                    <ol>
                        <li><a href="pages/discord.html">Discord</a>: Discord is a strong communication app, with solid voice communication and text communication.</li>
                        <li><a href="pages/oneDrive.html">One Drive</a>: One Drive is a file sharing app, with working folder struture, and the ability to edit, and share group documents.</li>
                        <li><a href="pages/voiceThread.html">Voice Threads</a>: voiceThreads is a interactive collaboration and sharing tool that lets you do voiceover's.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>

                    We at cameraStrike believe these three digital tools strong choices for both individual and group work, and are a top 
                    choice for students of any level.
